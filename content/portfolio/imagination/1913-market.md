The newly invented air-purifying interior material helps to make better indoor environments by decomposing pollutants in the air such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxides (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and etc. Due to the newly developed mixture of substances – photo catalyst and graphene – the surface of the material can react to the visible lights to change the monocular structure of pollutants. The invented purifying material can be applied onto furniture doors so furniture can be an energy-free purifier only requiring lights.
